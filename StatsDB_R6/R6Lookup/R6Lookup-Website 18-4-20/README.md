# Rainbow Six Siege Player Stats Website

This is a work in progress website to get Rainbow Six player statistics which uses Ubisoft's official API.

Before you want to use it you need to change de filename of api_ticket_git in the setStats folder to api_ticket and add an username and password of an ubisoft account to de config.php file (obviously not from an important ubisoft account).

While making this we used the existing Rainbow-Six-Siege-Player-Stats-API project from Seems2Legit, https://github.com/Seems2Legit/Rainbow-Six-Siege-Player-Stats-API.
